Webpack and npm Practice
Goal: Practice using npm and webpack to streamline your development process.

Separate logic into at least two JS files (business logic and interface logic). Use import and export statements to get them communicating.
Configure webpack to include all of the functionality covered in the section prework.
You are not expected to complete all of the options on this page. Start by following along with the prework. Then proceed to the journal project. If you have additional time, pick either Memory or Simon.
Feel free to expand on these problems to challenge yourself if you want, but only after your environment is fully set up.
We recommend building every webpack environment from scratch today. Then, in the future, you can copy/paste your configuration files and run $ npm install.


Journal
Create a journaling website where a user can write entries including at least a title and body. Create Entry objects that include a method to return the number of words in the entry. Then, add a separate method (or methods) to return the number of vowels and consonants in each entry. Finally, add a method called getTeaser to return the first sentence of the entry. If the sentence is over 8 words, only display those first 8 words.
